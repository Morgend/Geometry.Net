# GeometryKit

## What is it and why

GeometryKit is a library which contains geometry tools for .NET

This library was made because of a few reasons:
- to get simple geometry tools for my own .NET projects
- to make a prototype for similar C++ library (which will be published later)

I see no reason to hide it and I share it with the community.
